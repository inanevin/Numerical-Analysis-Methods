- For the given function in Assignment 2, the algorithms' time complexity is: O(n) linear time.
- The bigger the max iteration, time increases.
- The smaller the tolerance, time increases.

If we are to compare the 3 algorithms for the given function with the respective values of:

Tolerance : 0.001
MaxIterations : 100

With the hardware spec of:

Locked 60 FPS for Matlab Editor R2015a on 8 core processor with 4.97 Ghz:

Newtons Method: ~0.0510 - ~0.0592 seconds.
Secant Method: ~0.0683 - ~0.0736 seconds.
Fixed Point Iteration: ~0.3568 - ~0.3852 seconds.

It was observed that when tolerance was lowered around 0.00001 the newton's method time did not
change drastically meanwhile secant and fixed point iteration increased significantly.
(E.g Secant was ~0.1010 with 0.00001 tolerance)
